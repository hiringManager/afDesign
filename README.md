Various conversions from Diagrams.net

I've recieved permission from the Diagrams.net/Draw.io github to convert these assets. They are available under the Creative Commons license.

Feel free to leave any feedback about them. If you have any issues tell me and I'll see if I can clean them up at all. I'm new to Affinity Designer (purchased it two weeks ago) so I'm still learning a lot. 

If this generates some interest I'll continue converting what they have available.
